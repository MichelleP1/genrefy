**Currently waiting for quota extension for public accessibility. Until then, only users who have been added the the project will have access.**

Genrefy allows users to find new music by browsing an extensive list of genres on spotify. Users can find genres either randomly, or by browsing/searching a list. Once a genre has been selected, the user can navigate through relevant music to stream. They also have the ability to like/unlike tracks, and follow playlists.
